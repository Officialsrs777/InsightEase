# Reflection

1. **What I Learned**  
   - Gained hands‑on experience defining problem statements, user stories, and roadmaps—just like a PM.
   - Deepened my understanding of integrating AI (OpenAI API) into product workflows.
   - Practiced clear documentation and version control for collaborative projects.

2. **Challenges & Solutions**  
   - Dealt with API quota limits—implemented graceful error handling for a production‑ready feel.
   - Migrated code to support the latest OpenAI SDK interface (1.x) without breaking functionality.

3. **Next Steps**  
   - Gather user feedback to refine summaries.  
   - Expand to auto‑transcription and calendar integrations.  
   - Explore mobile/responsive design for on‑the‑go workflows.
